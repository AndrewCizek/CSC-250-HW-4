1. How long did you spend on this assignment?

An hour and fifteen minutes (ish).

2. Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?

I'd say an A. I like working on these, since I get more programming knowledge from them. Why wouldn't I put effort into them?

3. Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?

The solution is functional, but I had to convert binary to decimal to get it to work. There's certainly a more direct solution, so I'd say a B+ or A-.
At the end of the day, however, you know more about programming than me. I'm not really one to judge this.

4. Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.

It works pretty well, actually. The only thing that I couldn't figure out was a direct conversion. I definately struggled with finding out how to convert binary back to decimal.
